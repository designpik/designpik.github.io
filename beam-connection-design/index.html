<p>The design of these connections is more important -since the failure of connection is more catastrophic than the failure of the beam section. Part II is devoted primarily to connection examples that draw on the tables from the AISC Manual recommended design procedures and the breadth of the AISC Specification. I have two options for connection. Let us design a bolted beam splice connection for a UB 533 x 210 x 101 kgm section subjected to the following ultimate limit state loads.
