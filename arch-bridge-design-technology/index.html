<p>The technological aspects of construction influence the modern bridge industry from the very first steps of design. Though extremely versatile wood has one obvious disadvantage and during the 18th century there were many innovations in the design and a major breakthrough in bridge technology came with the erection of the Iron Bridge in Coalbrookdale in England during 1779 using cast iron for the first time as arches to cross the river Severn. Romans are often credited with the modern implementation of this technology but there are archways that have been found as far back as Ancient Egypt inside of buildings tombs and storage structures. The traditional design and practices for building Chinese wooden arch bridges combine the use of wood traditional architectural tools craftsmanship the core technologies of beam-weaving and mortise and tenon joints and a bearers understanding of different environments and the necessary structural mechanics. 5 Types Of Bridges Stem Grade 8 Bridge Building Engineering Science Civil Engineering.</p>
