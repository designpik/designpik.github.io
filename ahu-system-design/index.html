<p><strong>Ahu System Design</strong>, This is both a building system designed to keep the environment comfortable for building occupants and the industry that supports these systems. Note however the overall design of the HVAC system may place some system components outside of the confines of the AHU itself. Systemair offers a wide range of central air handling units for airflows up to 100000 m 3 h. In this case the section before the fan has negative pressure.</p>

<p>Typical AHU requires a flow rate of 24 gallonston. Also R32 is flammable refrigerant and the fire safety warranty for the whole system including outdoor unit must be done by your side when using R32 refrigerant. The snow drawn in though the louvers but not pulled into the AHU falls to the concrete plenum floor melts and leaks through the floor causing damage to the floor below.
