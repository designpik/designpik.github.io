<p><strong>Aware Design</strong>, A key component of our electrically aware design flow is the Cadence Virtuoso Layout Suite for Electrically Aware Design EAD. The tool lets design teams monitor electrical issues while a layout is created rather than waiting until the layout is completed before verifying that it meets the original design intent. After beginning with a motivation for the problem and trends seen in the semiconductor industry the survey presents a description. It covers several layers of the design hierarchy from technology circuit logic and architectural levels up to the system layer.</p>

<p>Is Something-Aware a design pattern. The parasitic-aware design flow maintains design intent through electrical and physical constraints raises abstraction through pre-layout estimates and speeds convergence on a manufacturable design.
