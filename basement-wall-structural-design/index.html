<p><strong>Basement Wall Structural Design</strong>, Frequently the basement walls are also laterally restrained at the base by the slab on grade so the shear key is seldom required. Tall basement walls or walls supporting structures that are outside the limitations of the prescriptive design path require calculations. Clayey soil can be higher. QuickWall can design walls that are made of masonry or cast-in-place concrete.</p>

<p>Type A is a tanked protection. The structural engineering basement wall designs are unique in the industry that requires no vertical reinforcement and the back fill can be placed with out first floor deck being in place. Our basement design software for structural engineer firms which is known as QuickWall has been in the structural engineering industry for two decades. In reinforced concrete wall the percentage of steel provided is greater than 04 and is designed similar to reinforced concrete columns. At a domestic scale the correct masonry construction to back up Type A barrier protection may be determined from the TBIC Guidance Document.</p>

<p>A sideways force against a basement wall puts one face of the wall in tension see Figure 1 next page and concretes tensile strength is much lower than its compressive strength. A retaining wall is then mainly exposed to lateral pressures from the retained soil plus any other surcharge. With residential basements I have seen lots of failures of walls designedbuilt by others.
