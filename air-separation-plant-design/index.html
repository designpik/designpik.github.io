<p>There are many safety features in the design and fabrication of an air separation plant including hydrocarbon detection and control oxygen cleanliness oxygen velocity control and choice of materials of construction. Air separation plants are typically referred to as air separation units or ASUs. Most of the problem components in the air separation process boil at temperatures above oxygen and hence will tend to concentrate in the oxygen product unless otherwise removed. The liquefaction of air to produce oxygen was the first engineering application of cryogenics and was initially used around the beginning of this century. 111448 Modi Vrajesh Gr.</p>
