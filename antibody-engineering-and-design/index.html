<p>We are focusing on developing tools and kits to facilitate and streamline antibody development at every stage including discovery generation and engineering. This course will also provide a chance to work hands-on. Antibody engineering is the modifying of monoclonal antibody mAb sequences andor structures to either enhance or dampen their functions especially for cancer therapy. Similarly in the development of computer algorithms rational design and in vitro selection methods can be used to counteract aggregation and predict high viscosity chemical degradation and rapid plasma clearance.
