<p><strong>Ball Check Valve Seat Design</strong>, In the closed position ball is pushed against the seat by the pressure of the fluid from upstream and hence can pressure seal the downstream of. Combination of SPE and DPE A trunnion mounted ball valve with the upstream seat unidirectional and the downstream seat bi-directional blocks the fluid at the downstream seat in both directions while it blocks the fluid on the upstream seat in one direction only. The ball is free to rotate resulting in even wear and a wiping action between the ball and seat. Depending on the valve and trim we can achieve temperatures in excess of 1000F for metal seated ball valves.</p>

<p>A Ball Check Valve is a simple and reliable valve with the only moving part to block the reverse flow is a spherical ball. The standard ball is designed with a NBR rubber lined metal core and the rubber hardness is optimized to prevent the ball from getting stuck in the seat. However like all other valves ball valves are generally rated at a lower pressure for steam service than for liquid or dry gaseous service. The metal-seated specialty-coated ball closes tightly against a set of precision coated and lapped seats providing zero-leakage if the hardened seating surfaces are not scratched by debris in the line.</p>

<p>However like all other valves ball valves are generally rated at a lower pressure for steam service than for liquid or dry gaseous service. The metal-seated ball valve design has enabled ball valves to take a big chunk out of the market share dominated for decades by the venerable gate valve. However like all other valves ball valves are generally rated at a lower pressure for steam service than for liquid or dry gaseous service. The ball is free to rotate resulting in even wear and a wiping action between the ball and seat.

<p>The standard ball is designed with a NBR rubber lined metal core and the rubber hardness is optimized to prevent the ball from getting stuck in the seat. Ball Check Valves are simple and compact and commonly used on small water or wastewater pumps where economy is important. I usually use 20-30 of seat diameter as a rough opening distance for the ball which gives a spring deflection of 0214 03 inch or spring delta-force of 0354 14 lbs acting on the projected seat area of 015in2 gives an additional 100 psi.

<p>However like all other valves ball valves are generally rated at a lower pressure for steam service than for liquid or dry gaseous service. This is an upper ballpark for the flowing check valve. In an HPLC device a pair of check valve inlet outlet prevent the flow from a high-pressure area into the low-pressure area because of which there is a continuous flow through the column at high pressure.
