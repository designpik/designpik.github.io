<p><strong>Adaptive Designs For Medical Device Clinical Studies</strong>, The US Food and Drug Administration FDA on Tuesday finalized guidance that lays out how to design medical device clinical trials that allow for changes based on data while maintaining study validity and integrity. An adaptive design for a medical device clinical study is defined as a clinical study design that allows for prospectively planned modifications based on accumulating study data without. The purpose is to. The pace of the uptake of adaptive designs in clinical research however has remained well behind that of the statistical literature introducing new methods and highlighting their potential advantages.</p>

By spelling out when adaptive designs are acceptable in clinical trials for devices requiring Premarket Approval PMA or 510k premarket notification the FDA seeks to better inform both device manufacturers and its own. SMi Groups Adaptive Designs in Clinical Trials Conference will return to London on 3rd and 4th April 2017 and will feature two case studies on Bayesian adaptive designs in medical device development.</p>

<p>Trial planning involves several rounds of simulations. It provides clarity on how to plan and implement adaptive designs for clinical studies used in medical device development. An adaptive design for a medical device clinical study is defined as a clinical study design that allows for prospectively planned modifications based on accumulating study data without. The 33-page guidance which finalizes a draft version released for comment in September 2018 and replaces an earlier guidance from 2010 sets out FDAs recommendations on adaptive trial design principles and the information FDA will review from adaptive studies submitted as part of investigational new drug applications INDs new drug applications.
