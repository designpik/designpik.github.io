<p><strong>Additive Manufacturing Generative Design</strong>, As you may know generative design is part of the family of Design for Additive Manufacturing DfAM techniques. If the set current view as or part orientation is changed does Fusion360 use the updated co-ordinates for the generative design orientation. Given that additive manufacturing enables a new level of design freedom it makes sense to use it for complex models that require a more flexible manufacturing method. The lack of structured knowledge on DfAM has been identified as one of the barriers that holds back further adoption of AM in industry 39 161 183.</p>

<p>The lack of structured knowledge on DfAM has been identified as one of the barriers that holds back further adoption of AM in industry 39 161 183. Read an overview in our Figure 3. If the set current view as or part orientation is changed does Fusion360 use the updated co-ordinates for the generative design orientation. Most generative design programs dont consider how the part will be manufactured so engineers must still use design for additive manufacturing DFAM principles to help create a better part that would reduce or eliminate the need for supports a process that requires a detailed understanding of the manufacturing process.
