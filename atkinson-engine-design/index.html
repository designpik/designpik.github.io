<p><strong>Atkinson Engine Design</strong>, The Atkinson cycle has a larger expansion ratio than compression ratio. The 2015 Chevy Cruise also has a 18 liter engine though with an Otto cycle and it produces 138 horsepower 7667 horsepowerliter. Its a clever solution where instead of the modern Atkinson style you have a traditional style Atkinson engine with a modern twist of allowing for variable compression ratio as well. As a matter of fact if you put a modern Atkinson cycle engine next to a modern Otto cycle engine you wouldnt be able to see any differenceTheres nothing in the Prius engine thats not in the regular engine according to David Lee at the University of Toyota.</p>

<p>Saw one at the bay area engine show a few weeks ago. One is an electric motor and the other power source is a 25L Atkinson-Cycle I4 Hybrid engine. Though Toyota has previously used Atkinson cycle engines in its hybrids its the first time that the Atkinson design will be used as a stand-alone unit and Atkinson Cycle engines arent known. Im now using 0003 and the compression so far just keeps improving as I run the engine.</p>

<p>The clever arrangement of levers allows the Atkinson engine to cycle the piston through all four strokes in only one revolution of the main crankshaft and allows the strokes to be different lengths. Atkinson engine is quite different in design as Atkison was trying to completely circumvent Ottos patents during the time of his invention. An Atkinson cycle engine makes less power than the otherwise equivalent Otto cycle unit which is why the design is more popular with hybrid models. A Uses the same four stroke cycle but delays the closing of the intake valve B Requires special fuel and oil designed for this type of engine. The 2015 Chevy Cruise also has a 18 liter engine though with an Otto cycle and it produces 138 horsepower 7667 horsepowerliter.</p>

The Atkinson engine shown here was an extremely ingenious design which not only successfully evaded the stranglehold of the Otto patents but also promised increased efficiency because it could give greater expansion of the combustion gases. This design allows shifting the piston motion curve in your favor whether you are looking for efficiency or power. The Atkinson Engine Engineering Drone Technology Blueprints.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact if you put a modern Atkinson cycle engine next to a modern Otto cycle engine you wouldnt be able to see any differenceTheres nothing in the Prius engine thats not in the regular engine according to David Lee at the University of Toyota. Purists will pooh-pooh the Atkinson cycle engine of today with nary a vibrating link in sight. Atkinson produced three different designs that had a short compression stroke and a longer expansion stroke. The original Atkinson cycle piston engine allowed the intake compression power and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto cycle enginesDue to the unique crankshaft design of the Atkinson its expansion ratio can differ from its compression ratio and with a power stroke longer.
