<p><strong>Bicycle Water Pump Design</strong>, The conventional centrifugal pump needs either electricity or diesel engine but the present innovation works on pedaling. The system comprises a bicycle rim belt-pulley impeller and inlet and delivery pipes. The idea is a hydroelectric science experiment station where kids interact with water its properties its kinetic energy and even test rainwater samples. This DIY water pump design uses centrifugal force to pump water where it needs to go.</p>

<p>2 conducted an experiment on Pedal powered water pump. In the first year two EWB-Sheffield volunteers came to Butterfly and built the first prototype of a pedal-powered water pump. It works on the principle of compression and sudden release of a tube by creating negative pressure in the tube and this vacuum created draws water from the sump. Bicycle Water Pump is a centrifugal water pump which is run by rotating the pedal of a cycle.</p>

<p>A final discussion recommends the development of a bicycle powered cable tool drilling unit to reduce the cost of drilled wells for the application of these pump units. The design is based on a successful design used by Maya. Ed improved design for a single acting pump. Previous Next Bicycle Water Pump This project started back in 2013 and is based on a six year partnership between Butterfly and Engineers without Borders Sheffield. The system comprises a bicycle rim belt-pulley impeller and inlet and delivery pipes.</p>
