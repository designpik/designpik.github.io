<p>1 Consideration of design is also important because the design of a study will govern how the data are to be analysed. It is often an overview of clinical trials. Sample size for before-after study Paired T-test Measure a continuous outcome y in each subject at the start and end of the study period. In clinical study refers to an experimental design which analyzes results before and after trials.</p>

<p>In clinical study refers to an experimental design which analyzes results before and after trials. The simplest design is also probably the least accurate and desirable. For each subject calculate the change Δ y end - y start. Each study design has their own inherent strengths and weaknesses and there can be a general hierarchy in study designs however any hierarchy cannot be applied uniformly across study design types 3569. The aim of these studies is to know what effects a cause.</p>

<p>1 Consideration of design is also important because the design of a study will govern how the data are to be analysed. In general uncontrolled before and after studies should not be used to evaluate the effects of quality improvement interventions and the results of studies using such designs have to be interpreted with great caution. The intervention can either be delivered by the investigator or by others observational before and after study.
