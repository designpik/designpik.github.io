<p>One might legitimately say that the goal of applied research is to improve human conditions. Systems design is the process of defining elements of a system like modules architecture components and their interfaces and data for a system based on the specified requirements. The applied arts incorporate design and creative ideals to objects of utility such as a cup. It means that the process will be individualized by searching a lot on the Internet or talking by the phone or texting people. A design that produces the least margin of error in experimental research is generally considered the desired outcome.</p>
