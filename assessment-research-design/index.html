<p><strong>Assessment Research Design</strong>, Research design is a plan to answer your research question. The research design refers to the overall strategy that you choose to integrate the different components of the study in a coherent and logical way thereby ensuring you will effectively address the research problem. Assessment Design Redesign In the development or redevelopment of any assessment there are key design decisions made early in the process that set up the framework for the subsequent steps. Giving students an assessment of knowledge the first day of class and giving the same assessment on the last day of class is an example of a research design based on a single-sample repeated measures.</p>

<p>Research design and methods are different but closely related because good research design ensures that the data you obtain will help you answer your research question more effectively. A research method is a strategy used to implement that plan. As discussed above the design of an assessment system should be based on a carefully devised plan that considers the purpose of each of the system components and how they will serve to improve student learning. A design method in which the same group is tested at multiple points in time.</p>
