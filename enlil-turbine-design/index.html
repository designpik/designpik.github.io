<p>Design of a new method of generation of electricity using the wind energy generated by the moving vehicles on the highways. This paper aims to design and analysis of savonius vertical axis wind turbine which can generate power from wind and is used for residential purposes in rural areas affected by electricity. The principal objective of this project is design modelling and simulation of a Darrieus rotor Vertical Axis Wind Turbine. IceWind designs and manufactures robust micro vertical-axis wind turbines and other hybrid energy solutions to power telecom towers weather and seismic stations and on-grid and off-grid lodgings. By placing the hybrid vertical axis wind turbine inclueding a solar panel on top of it on highways Metrobus-lines and other transportation lines as well as high-rise residences ENLIL will generate energy by using the winds created by the vehicles aswell as the natural winds.</p>

<p>Vertical axis wind turbines come in many shapes but technically they can be categorized in to two groups based on their operational principles. The vertical design allows engineers to place the turbines closer together. Modern well-designed standard wind turbines have a life expectancy of 20 years something ENLIL could one day exceed due to its simplicity and durability.

<p>DESIGN METHODOLOGY Optimum design of the turbine is very important in the development of this project. The hybrid design was developed to increase the performances of the vertical axis turbines from wind turbine types and to widen their usage areas. The comparison of the hybrid design with the conventional wind turbines were carried out by comparing their performance indexes such as efficiency torque and tip-speed ratio. They also generate energy from the wind itself. Design Of Wind Turbine Tower Height And Blade Length An Optimization Approach Semantic Scholar.</p>
