<p>To design the gears the specifications of the engine are considered as follows. In automobiles the differential allows the outer drive wheel to rotate faster than the inner drive wheel during a turn. The differential case is mounted with two-wheel axles and differential side gears. The differential case has bearings that rotate two axle shafts.</p>

Construction of differential - The standard differential mainly consists of 3 parts 1. The differential is found on all modern cars and trucks and also in many all-wheel-drive full-time four-wheel-drive vehicles. A differential is a gear train with three shafts that has the property that the rotational speed of one shaft is the average of the speeds of the others or a fixed multiple of that average. 25 Animations That Explain How Your Car Works Mechanical Design Automotive Engineering Automobile Engineering.</p>
