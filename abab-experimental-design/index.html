This article describes and discusses some commonly used single-case experimental designs including reversal and non-reversal designs. The ABAB design is intended to reveal a functional relationship between an experimental treatment and a behavior targeted for change. The A-B-A-B design represents an attempt to measure a baseline the first A a treatment measurement the first B the withdrawal of treatment the second A and the re-introduction of treatment the second B.</p>

<p>Additionally many clinicianseducators prefer the ABAB design because the investigation ends with a treatment phase rather than the absence of an intervention. The A-B-A-B design is recommended for use when reversal designs can be used and when the patients treatment phase needs to be maintained. ABA therapy utilizes behavioral principles to set goals reinforce behaviors and measure outcomes. ABA designs typically start with a baseline period where behaviour is monitored before an intervention stage where behaviour is monitored whilst a treatment is administered.

The percentage of time he spent studying the dependent variable was low during the first baseline phase increased during the first treatment phase until it leveled off decreased during the second baseline phase and again increased during the second treatment phase. Drawbacks to ABAB and reversal designs are ethical concerns and the irreversibility of certain targets. For example it might be used to establish a functional relationship between the use of the plural form of a noun and a treatment such as praise following the occurrence of a plural noun. Ace Lab.</p>

<p>The percentage of time he spent studying the dependent variable was low during the first baseline phase increased during the first treatment phase until it leveled off decreased during the second baseline phase and again increased during the second treatment phase. After establishing a stable baseline the treatment effect is turned on and off like a light switch. ABA design also known as a withdrawal or reversal design is a type of single subject experimental design which allows researchers to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention. This design is useful for demonstrating functional relations with performance behaviors. Section 5 Experimental Designs Part 2 Flashcards Quizlet.</p>

<p>After establishing a stable baseline the treatment effect is turned on and off like a light switch. The ABAB design is superior to the ABA design because a single reversal is not strong enough for the effectiveness of the treatment. Drawbacks to ABAB and reversal designs are ethical concerns and the irreversibility of certain targets.
