<p>Augmented reality dashboards are already a reality in BMW vehicles but industry experts predict that 70 percent of new cars will incorporate them by 2020. Recent work is described that extends design synthesis and optimisation to cover a far wider range of air-vehicle concepts and links concept design optimisation to multi-disciplinary analysis and optimisation. An essentially pragmatic approach the Airflow also kept the traditional Body On Frame BOF front-engine RWD standard but made some significant advances in terms vehicle design by pushing the engine further forward over the front wheels.

<p>All factors of a vehicles capabilitiesacceleration handling braking safety efficiencycan improve through the use of advanced lighter materials. An essentially pragmatic approach the Airflow also kept the traditional Body On Frame BOF front-engine RWD standard but made some significant advances in terms vehicle design by pushing the engine further forward over the front wheels. Those advanced materialssuch as plastics and polymer composites carbon fiber-reinforced plastics 3-D printed plastic parts even plastic parts made from carbon dioxideare enabling remarkable. Advances in Vehicle Design is an introduction to vehicle and body systems in the sense of providing readers with an insight into analytical methods given in a wide variety of published sources such as technical journals conference papers and proceedings of engineering institutions for which a comprehensive list of references is provided.
