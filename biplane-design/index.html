The biplane blade design uses a biplane inboard region that transitions into a joint which is connected to a monoplane outboard region. In recent years the Busemann biplane is widely studied including the wing-body configuration 1617 sonic boom flutter and aerodynamic performance in hypersonic conditions 2021However the flow choking problem caused by the internal contraction section decreases the performances in the off-design conditions dramatically. Vernon Paynes inspired design actually pre-staged all other homebuilt biplanes and when it was introduced in 1929 was radical in the extreme.
