<p><strong>Advantages And Disadvantages Of Analytical Research Design</strong>, Following are the disadvantages of data Analytics. Advantages and Disadvantages of Content Analysis Kerlingers 2000 define content analysis as Content Analysis is a method of studying and analyzing communication in a systematic objective and quantitative manner for the purpose of measuring variables. Experimental design involves manipulating the independent variable to observe the effect on the dependent variable. In addition it obtains information on the phenomenon or situation to be studied using techniques such as observation and survey among others.</p>

<p>When the same results occur multiple times then there is more confidence in the data produced. Experimental design involves manipulating the independent. Advantages of using qualitative data analysis software include being freed from manual and clerical tasks saving time being able to deal with large amounts of qualitative data having increased flexibility and having improved validity and auditability of qualitative research. Furthermore the Quality by Design approach for optimizing formulation methods has several advantages such as reducing the number of experiments cost-effectiveness and considerably less. The Descriptive Analysis is criticized for its incapability to show cause and effect and predictions for example the relationship between two variables cannot be concluded as causal relationship.</p>

<p>Quantitative research requires careful experimental design and the ability for anyone to replicate both the test and the results. One of the other advantages of the research is that introduces new hypotheses that can guide further experimental inferential or analytical studies. The advantages of descriptive research include data collection and life experiences while the method can be disadvantageous in the.
