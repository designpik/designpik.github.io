<p>Companies are using augmented reality for interior design architecture design data visualization learning and so much more. Hence AR is an enhanced version of reality which is created with the help of technology to overlay interior design to our real current world. Virtual realitydevices that block out the external world and present the user with a wholly fabricated visual experiencecan be useful to architects and designers. Interior design is one of the most popular applications of the AR technology due to providing cost savings and reducing time in interior design creation.</p>
