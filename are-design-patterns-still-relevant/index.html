<p><strong>Are Design Patterns Still Relevant</strong>, The ideas of functionality and attainability are what make mid-century furniture so resilient against the tide of time we still look for the same qualities in modern-day furniture design. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects. Design patterns are always relevant as it is the blueprint to solve common problems. The GOF design patterns book was first published in 1994 and many of its patterns are still considered relevant.</p>

<p>Design patterns are simply solution patterns to common problems. There are many other books discussing design patterns and countless other patterns have been described and analysed. I would think most people are using design patterns without knowing that they are. Design patterns are spoonfeed material for brainless programmers incapable of independent thought who will be resolved to producing code as mediocre as the design patterns they use to create it.</p>
