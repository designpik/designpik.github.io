<p>We supply attic hatches that are available with or without attached ladders and come with insulation and a sealing system for the door and surrounding frame. However some scuttle attics design incorporates a pull-down stair set usable after the cover hatch is open. This allows us to fully insulate the access with batt insulation to the same R-Value as the rest of the attic and to achieve a proper 100 vapour barrier seal. I found a good article that has a bit more information on scuttle attics if youd like to read more. Ships Ladder Ship Ladder Attic Ladder Attic Remodel.</p>
