<p>A special kind of. Linear model covariational statistics presume too much about how causes and effects are inter-related to rely on for adequately informing such research so SHP needs a less presumptive and more data sensitive form of study design and data analysis the associational model. Research design may collect both qualitative and quantitative data but qualitative methods emphasize observations about natural behavior and artifacts that capture social life as it is experienced by the participants rather than in categories predetermined by the researcher. Relationships among two or more variables are studied without any attempt to influence them.

<p>General Types of Educational Research. The basic associational research approach examines the relation between two continuous variables or at least ones that have many ordered levels leading to a correlation coefficient. A positive relationship between two variables is when an increase in one variable leads to a rise in the other variable. The 3 methods of data collection in correlational research are naturalistic observation method archival data method and the survey method.
