<p><strong>Algorithm Design Parallel And Sequential</strong>, A significant amount of work is being done to develop efficient parallel algorithms for a variety of parallel architectures. In this course you will learn to design analyze and program sequential and parallel algorithms and data structures. A parallel algorithm is an algorithm that has been specifically written for execution on a computer with two or more processors. These algorithms are well suited to todays computers which basically perform operations in a sequential fashion.</p>
