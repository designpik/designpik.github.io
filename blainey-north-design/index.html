<p>Get to know Blainey North and their Best Design Projects Blainey North Associates is a global design firm specialising in interior architecture and the design of luxury environments. Blainey North Design - Vecchio Side Table - The diversity of elements in the Vecchio culminates in the gloss timber top that lies at the heart of this table. Blainey North designs her own furniture and has a very successful collection inspired by the Art Deco style. I was fortunate enough to enjoy the opulence of the 54 Park St health club while working at ACP Magazines - there arent too many other gyms in Sydney that have a chandelier hanging above the pool.
