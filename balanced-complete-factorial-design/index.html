<p>It needs to be a whole number in order for the design to be balanced. A fractional factorial design uses a subset of a full factorial design so some of the main effects and 2-way interactions are confounded and cannot be separated from the effects of other higher-order interactions. The ASQC 1983 Glossary Tables for Statistical Quality Control defines fractional factorial design in the following way. The analysis is straightforward. Furthermore the non-linear relationships between the sample size the power and the detectable standardized effect size are interpretable by investigating the diagnostic graphs of the package.</p>

<p>In factorial design a balanced experiment could also mean that the same factor is being run the same number of times for all levels. It needs to be a whole number in order for the design to be balanced. A fractional factorial design uses a subset of a full factorial design so some of the main effects and 2-way interactions are confounded and cannot be separated from the effects of other higher-order interactions.

In statistics a full factorial experiment is an experiment whose design consists of two or more factors each with discrete possible values or levels and whose experimental units take on all possible combinations of these levels across all such factors.

<p>Although many designs satisfy both criteria some such as Central Composite designs forego design balance in favor of data. The experimental design must be of the factorial type no nested or repeated-measures factors with no missing cells. Full Factorial Design leads to experiments where at least one trial is included for all possible combinations of factors and levels.
