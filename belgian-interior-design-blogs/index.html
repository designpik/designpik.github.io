<p>Kitchen isle cabinetry is executed in French oak given a light stained finish. Plenty of light and a practical layout meshes with the typical Belgian kitchen colours to form something truly unique. Painted European antiques with carved and flourished edges pendulous swagged roses bits of Fortuny and glittering crystal a trace of gilding. I like this Belgian Style.
