<p>Each stage incorporates a goal that must be reached before the project team may advance to the next stage Figure 2. The design team for retrofitting existing laboratory space is usually smaller and less formal but is still comprised a number of people with specialized skills including the builder electrician mechanic plumber and the laboratory manager or director. It can also improve your bottom line by boosting productivity maximizing flexibility and reducing energy costs. Design for adjacent spaces for storage and consumption of food and drink as needed. It shouldnt be too long and it must include the dependent and independent variables.</p>
