<p>Making those improvements is trickier in radial motors with an in-runner design where the rotor is inside the stator. What are the Applications of Axial Flux Motor. Duke re-imagined the design utilizing a reciprocator converting the linear layout into a circular or axial configurationand the results are stunning. Axial flux motors were studied by British inventor and EV enthusiast Cedric Lynch as early as 1979. His brushed DC motor design held the magnets stationary with a spinning armature activated by sliding brushes as the rotor.</p>
