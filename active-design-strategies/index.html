<p>To put this into context if a passive design provides ventilation and heating using natural non powered systems a building using active design will achieve the same end but have to use technologies such as solar panels heat recovery systems or the use of renewable energy sources such as wind turbines. Active Design is a combination of 10 principles that promote activity health and stronger communities through the way we design and build our towns and cities. Active and Passive Spaces I n general active spaces are those which are designed for the public and generate income whereas passive spaces include all private spaces such as the prescription area and dispensary that do not generate income but are dependant on. You would even consider solar energy capture as an active process.</p>
