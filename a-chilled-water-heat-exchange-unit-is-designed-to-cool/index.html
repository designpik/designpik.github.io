<p>At the heart of the water chilled system a chiller removes heat from water by means of a refrigeration cycle. Chilled water cooling is not very different from typical residential air conditioning where water is pumped from the chiller to the air handler unit to cool the air. There must be a temperature difference for heat to flow. Full calculations are shown below. - Carrier SmartVuTM Control system.</p>
