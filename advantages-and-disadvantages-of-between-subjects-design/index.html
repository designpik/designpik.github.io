<p>Name other threats to internal validity besides individual differences to a between subjects design 1 Differential attrition. A within-subjects design is an experiment in which the same group of subjects serves in more than one treatment. Because each participant is only measured once researchers need to add a new group for every treatment and manipulation. 3Taking part in different levels of the treatment condition or taking the measurement tests several times might help the participants become more skilled. However in within subjects design a group of participants participate in two or more conditions.</p>
